# Questions for the Product Owner(s)

- Should the `donor add` command be able to set ALL attributes of the Donor, or is it okay if necessary to use `donor update` to set all other attributes?
- Can you run the hashtag checker script and tell people in the class who's doing the hashtags incorrectly?
