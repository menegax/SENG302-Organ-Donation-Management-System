# Questions for Tutors
Technical questions that we don't know how to fix!

- How to link `/docs` folder to GitLab Wiki?
- How to test Database when `donors` variable is static? DonorTest adding ird=12 and DatabaseTest adding ird=12 conflict when they're completely separate ird numbers.
- Should Database disk writing/reading be manual tests? Otherwise writing will depend on correct reading to determine if write was successful
- Should we add a `odms >>` prefix to every command in CLI
- How to add auto reformat to Maven build
