# Questions for Tutors
Technical questions that we don't know how to fix!

- Weird pause and blank response when only entering `donor` in CLI
- GitLab Runner... working?
- What's up with storing Donors as a HashSet\<Donor>? Benefits?
- How do we automate CLI testing?
- How to link `/docs` folder to GitLab Wiki?
- How to test Database when `donors` variable is static? DonorTest adding ird=12 and DatabaseTest adding ird=12 conflict when they're completely separate ird numbers.
