# Code Review Questionnaire

* Have the developers on the story gone through DoD? Ask them. If not, stop the review. Else continue questionnaire.
* Has the story passed the story DoD?
* It's in the DoD, but it's important: has the story passed the acceptance criteria?
* Are classes named accordingly? (i.e. GUIDonorUpdateProfile not DonorProfileUpdate)
* Are classes placed in the correct package? (i.e. undo/redo in utility)
* How does the code look? Can you read and understand what it does easily?
* Can SENG301 principles be followed more closely anywhere?
